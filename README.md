# Chess openings core

Small GUI chess engine, written in OOP Typescript.

> Please dont use in some serious projects, this libary is not properly tested and bugs could arise.

## Plain TS?

Yup, packaged with Rollup into ES module, this should work just ok with any framework or without it.

## Why OOP design?

Im fond of writing functional code, but considering this use case, making this project as OOP mutable structures is far more easier.

## Tweakable?

Im still working on making this project nicely configurable - currently there are few options to pass, take a look.
